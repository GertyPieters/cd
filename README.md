Finally, write a short, 200/300-word report in which you discuss at least the following:

Name three components of your solution, explain what they are and how they relate to each other. A 'component' can be anthing from GitHub Actions or Bash to Digital Ocean and SSH.
Discuss three problems that you encountered along the way and how you solved them.
(optional) Anything of note that you want to share about the process of solving this assignment.

## Components of my solution:
### 1. Digital Ocean:
  For this assignment I had to create a VPS on Digital Ocean. Although this is something we did in a previous exercise, it was an important component of this solution. 
  The droplet was easy to create, learning to work with the console involved some trial and error, but after a while I grew more familiar with it. To make everything
  work it involved some installing of programs like: nano, python, pip, flask, nginx, gunicorn, etc.  
  You can't (in a way) do something wrong with it, because it always tells you that you are doing something that can't be done or that you are doing it wrong. And to 
  make changes in, for example, directories, you already have to know what you are doing.  

### 2. Linux:
  By working with Digital Ocean and Ubuntu you are also working with Linux. Linux is an operating system and it made me feel more comfortable using CLI.

## Problems I had to deal with:
1. Working with Digital Ocean, I had a few problems. I couln't log on to the console because it didn't have enough memory. So I had to resize before I could do anything
  else. A little strange I guess. Later on in the process I couldn't log in for some reason and when I tried to submit a ticket to solve the problem, you had to be
  logged in to submit a ticket. It was a strange loop. Ultimately I changed my password and that got me in.

2. I knew I had to clone my repository but I just couldn't figure out where it had to be cloned to. It is strange to learn that sometimes the 'wires' in my brain just
  don't seem to connect, but then, all at once, they do and you see what it's about. After that, when you look back, you can't see why you couldn't figure it out in the
  first place.
